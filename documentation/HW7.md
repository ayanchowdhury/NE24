Why I think this developer guide is useful: I think this developer guide is useful because it is clear in how android apps work
and how they should function. Additionally, this developer guide describes how to use the most of what Google has to offer so 
that your app can work in the best possible way. With its limitless resources even beginners like me could begin to understand 
how to use and develop for Android.
